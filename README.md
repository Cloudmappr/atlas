# Overview
Atlas is a conceptual structure visualization and annotation platform featuring a modular interactive renderer that allows the user to create or calculate multiple structured or unstructured views of their data (represented as "Elements" in the object model). These views can be shared with others, and the same data may be represented in different views while maintaining consistency.

The front-end is paired with a simple, flexible and scalable multi-user key/value store for user annotation of the data, along with subsequent reporting.

The same data set can be leveraged in multiple structures, leaving the user free to create multiple structures of the same library. The links between each element in the renderer can carry its own attributes, allowing for dynamic re-representation, aggregation, and summarization of data based on the rendered view.  This allows visual and quantitative comparison based on the relationships defined by the user in the renderer.
