# noSQL Learning Path

## 1. Understand NoSQL Basics
Types of NoSQL Databases: Familiarize yourself with the four major types:
- Document (e.g., MongoDB, Couchbase)
- Key-Value (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB)
- Column-Family (e.g., Cassandra, HBase)
- Graph (e.g., Neo4j, ArangoDB)
- **Use Cases**: Learn how NoSQL databases differ from relational ones and when to use them (e.g., scalability, flexible schema).

- Recommended Resources:
  - Books: "NoSQL Distilled" by Pramod J. Sadalage and Martin Fowler
  - Online Tutorials: MongoDB University, DataStax Academy for Cassandra

## 2. Hands-On Practice with a NoSQL Database
Start with a popular choice like MongoDB or DynamoDB for document-based use cases.
  - MongoDB Compass for visualization
  - Cloud-based services like AWS DynamoDB or Azure CosmosDB for scalability
  - Perform basic operations:
  - Data insertion, querying, updating, and deletion
  - Indexing and aggregation pipelines

## 3. Map Your Knowledge to NoSQL Concepts
From Tabular to Document/Key-Value:
- Learn how tabular data translates to JSON-like structures.
- Practice denormalization techniques for embedding or referencing data.
- **Querying**: Translate SQL-style queries into NoSQL query syntax (e.g., MongoDB Aggregation Framework).
- **Optimization**: Study indexing, sharding, and replication.

## 4. Learn Schema Design in NoSQL
- Understand schema-less database design principles.
- Plan for scalability by designing for the specific NoSQL database chosen.
- Avoid common pitfalls like inefficient data structure choices.

## 5. Integrate NoSQL with Your Project
- Use libraries or connectors for NoSQL in your preferred programming language (e.g., Python's PyMongo, Node.js drivers).
- Work on integrating NoSQL with Qlik or other analytics platforms, possibly by exporting NoSQL data to compatible tabular formats or leveraging APIs.

## 6. Explore Advanced Topics
- Distributed database concepts (CAP Theorem, consistency models)
- Advanced indexing and querying features
- Real-world scaling strategies for high-performance NoSQL systems

## 7. Apply Learning to Your Project
- Start with a small prototype or proof of concept.
- Test thoroughly for edge cases like query performance, data consistency, and fault tolerance.
- Iterate on design based on feedback and practical needs.
